# Multigraph for Airport/Flight Dataset

Implementation of the Multigraph Data Structure and application of the following problems:
- Path-Finding;
- Spanning Tree;
- Erd√µs Number;

## Dataset

The original dataset was obtained from:
[Flights and Airports Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/flights-and-airports-data?select=raw-flight-data.csv)

## Installation Details 

To run this code, a C++ compiler (such as GCC) is required, along with a Python installation. 
There's a Makefile to create an executable to run the program. To use this, the *make* command is needed - be sure to have it installed in your system.
Additionally, please install the Python libraries specified in the "requirements.txt" file located in this repository. This can be done using the following command:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Commands

The Makefile contains two targets: menu and test. The menu target generates an executable that allows you to use the application, while the test target is used for testing the application. To build each target, use the following commands:
```cmd
make menu
```
```cmd
make test
```

After building, you can run the application using the following commands:

For the *menu* target:
```cmd
./project.exe
```

For the *test* target:
```cmd
./tester.exe
```
